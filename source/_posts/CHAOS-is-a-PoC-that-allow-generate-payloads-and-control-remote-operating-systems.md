## FAQ
> #### Why does Keylogger capture all uppercase letters?
> All the letters obtained using the keylogger are uppercase letters. It is a known issue, in case anyone knows how to fix the Keylogger function using golang, please contact me or open an issue.

> #### Why are necessary get and install external libraries?
> To implement the screenshot function i used a third-party library, you can check it in https://github.com/kbinani/screenshot and https://github.com/lxn/win. You must download and install it to generate the payload.
